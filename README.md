# Tetris Bot

## Overview

This project is a Tetris bot trained using evolutionary algorithms. The bot utilizes statistical properties and weights optimized through evolutionary algorithms to play Tetris effectively.

## Features

- **Evolutionary Training**: The bot is trained using evolutionary algorithms, where a fitness function is defined to evaluate the performance of the bot, and weights are optimized to maximize this fitness.
  
- **Statistical Properties**: The bot incorporates various statistical properties of the game to make decisions, such as piece placements, rotations, holes, height, bumpiness, etc.
  
- **Customizable Fitness Function**: Users can define and customize the fitness function based on their requirements and preferences.
  

## Installation

To install the Tetris bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/adithyasai2020/dumb-tetris-game-v2.git`

## Usage

To run the Tetris bot, execute the following command:


This will start the bot, and it will begin playing Tetris automatically.

## Customization

### Fitness Function

You can customize the fitness function by modifying the `engine.js` file. This file contains the definition of the fitness function, where you can adjust weights and include additional statistical properties as needed.

### Evolutionary Algorithm

To customize the evolutionary algorithm parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, and number of generations, modify the `mutation` section in `main.js` file.
